    dwidenoise [ options ]  dwi out

-  *dwi*: the input diffusion-weighted image.
-  *out*: the output denoised DWI image.

Description
-----------

DWI data denoising and noise map estimation by exploiting data redundancy in the PCA domain using the prior knowledge that the eigenspectrum of random covariance matrices is described by the universal Marchenko-Pastur (MP) distribution. Fitting the MP distribution to the spectrum of patch-wise signal matrices hence provides an estimator of the noise level 'sigma'; this noise level estimate then determines the optimal cut-off for PCA denoising.

Important note: image denoising must be performed as the first step of the image processing pipeline. The routine will fail if interpolation or smoothing has been applied to the data prior to denoising.

Note that this function does not correct for non-Gaussian noise biases present in magnitude-reconstructed MRI images. If available, including the MRI phase data can reduce such non-Gaussian biases, and the command now supports complex input data.

If the input data are of complex type, then a linear phase term will be removed from each k-space prior to PCA. In the absence of metadata indicating otherwise, it is inferred that the first two axes correspond to acquired slices, and different slices / volumes will be demodulated individually; this behaviour can be modified using the -demod_axes option.

The sliding spatial window behaves differently at the edges of the image FoV depending on the shape / size selected for that window. The default behaviour is to use a spherical kernel centred at the voxel of interest, whose size is some multiple of the number of input volumes; where some such voxels lie outside of the image FoV, the radius of the kernel will be increased until the requisite number of voxels are used. For a spherical kernel of a fixed radius, no such expansion will occur, and so for voxels near the image edge a reduced number of voxels will be present in the kernel. For a cuboid kernel, the centre of the kernel will be offset from the voxel being processed such that the entire volume of the kernel resides within the image FoV.

The size of the default spherical kernel is set to select a number of voxels that is 1.0 / 0.85 ~ 1.18 times the number of volumes in the input series. If a cuboid kernel is requested, but the -extent option is not specified, the command will select the smallest isotropic patch size that exceeds the number of DW images in the input data; e.g., 5x5x5 for data with <= 125 DWI volumes, 7x7x7 for data with <= 343 DWI volumes, etc.

Permissible sizes for the cuboid kernel depend on the subsampling factor. If no subsampling is performed, or the subsampling factor is odd, then the extent(s) of the kernel must be odd, such that a unique voxel lies at the very centre of each kernel. If however an even subsampling factor is used, then the extent(s) of the kernel must be even, reflecting the fact that it is a voxel corner that resides at the centre of the kernel.In either case, if the extent is specified manually, the user can either provide a single integer---which will determine the number of voxels in the kernel across all three spatial axes---or a comma-separated list of three integers,individually defining the number of voxels in the kernel for all three spatial axes.

By default, optimal value shrinkage based on minimisation of the Frobenius norm will be used to attenuate eigenvectors based on the estimated noise level. Hard truncation of sub-threshold components and inclusion of supra-threshold components---which was the behaviour of the dwidenoise command in version 3.0.x---can be activated using -filter truncate.Alternatively, optimal truncation as described in Gavish and Donoho 2014 can be utilised by specifying -filter optthresh.

-aggregation exclusive corresponds to the behaviour of the dwidenoise command in version 3.0.x, where the output intensities for a given image voxel are determined exclusively from the PCA decomposition where the sliding spatial window is centred at that voxel. In all other use cases, so-called "overcomplete local PCA" is performed, where the intensities for an output image voxel are some combination of all PCA decompositions for which that voxel is included in the local spatial kernel. There are multiple algebraic forms that modulate the weight with which each decomposition contributes with greater or lesser strength toward the output image intensities. The various options are: 'gaussian': A Gaussian distribution with FWHM equal to twice the voxel size, such that decompisitions centred more closely to the output voxel have greater influence; 'invl0': The inverse of the L0 norm (ie. rank) of each decomposition, as used in Manjon et al. 2013; 'rank': The rank of each decomposition, such that high-rank decompositions contribute more strongly to the output intensities regardless of distance between the output voxel and the centre of the decomposition kernel; 'uniform': All decompositions that include the output voxel in the sliding spatial window contribute equally.

Options
-------

Options for modifying PCA computations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **-datatype float32/float64** Datatype for the eigenvalue decomposition (single or double precision). For complex input data, this will select complex float32 or complex float64 datatypes.

-  **-estimator algorithm** Select the noise level estimator (default = Exp2), either:  |br|
   * Exp1: the original estimator used in Veraart et al. (2016);  |br|
   * Exp2: the improved estimator introduced in Cordero-Grande et al. (2019);  |br|
   * Med: estimate based on the median eigenvalue as in Gavish and Donohue (2014);  |br|
   * MRM2022: the alternative estimator introduced in Olesen et al. (2022).

Options for controlling the sliding spatial window kernel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **-shape choice** Set the shape of the sliding spatial window. Options are: cuboid,sphere; default: sphere

-  **-radius_mm value** Set an absolute spherical kernel radius in mm

-  **-radius_ratio value** Set the spherical kernel size as a ratio of number of voxels to number of input volumes (default: 1.0/0.85 ~= 1.18)

-  **-extent window** Set the patch size of the cuboid kernel; can be either a single integer or a comma-separated triplet of integers (see Description)

-  **-subsample factor** reduce the number of PCA kernels relative to the number of image voxels; can provide either an integer subsampling factor, or a comma-separated list of three factors;default: 2

Options for phase demodulation of complex data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **-nodemod** disable phase demodulation

-  **-demod_axes axes** comma-separated list of axis indices along which FFT can be applied for phase demodulation

Options that affect reconstruction of the output image series
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **-mask image** Only denoise voxels within the specified binary brain mask image.

-  **-filter choice** Modulate how component contributions are filtered based on the cumulative eigenvalues relative to the noise level; options are: optshrink,optthresh,truncate; default: optshrink (Optimal Shrinkage based on minimisation of the Frobenius norm)

-  **-aggregator choice** Select how the outcomes of multiple PCA outcomes centred at different voxels contribute to the reconstructed DWI signal in each voxel; options are: exclusive,gaussian,invl0,rank,uniform; default: Gaussian

Options for exporting additional data regarding PCA behaviour
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **-noise_out image** The output noise map, i.e., the estimated noise level 'sigma' in the data. Note that on complex input data, this will be the total noise level across real and imaginary channels, so a scale factor sqrt(2) applies.

-  **-patchcount image** The number of unique patches to which an image voxel contributes

-  **-sum_aggregation image** The sum of aggregation weights of those patches contributing to each output voxel

-  **-sum_optshrink image** the sum of eigenvector weights computed for the denoising patch centred at each voxel as a result of performing optimal shrinkage

Standard options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
